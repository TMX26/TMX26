I’m @TMX26. Without the @, that's just to make sure you know when my name starts. I'll let you guess when it finishes, I think it's fairly obvious. HINT: it's before a certain punctuation mark! 
No time for greetings, social interactions are just a life-long conversation anyway. 

I’m interested in uh... stuff made out of cells... and stuff that moves on its own. Cyborgs and anything mechanical really. Like cars. They're cool. With real engines though. The ones that go boom and burn dinosaur juice. Not those quiet wooshy things that run off stored lightning or something. Yeah I'm a stereotypical male in the regard. But I don't care.

I’m currently studying bioengineering. It's mostly cellular biology and physics, it's pretty cool . 

I’m looking to collaborate on... uh... well... we're done with our project. Nothing left to do but use it.

How to reach me ... just DM me? How else would you reach me? Send me a letter?

I’m @TMX26. Without the @, that's just to make sure you know when my name starts. I'll let you guess when it finishes, I think it's pretty obious. HINT: it's after a certain punctuation mark. 
No time for greetings either, social interactions are just a long conversation anyway. 

I’m interested in uh... stuff made out of cells... and stuff that moves on it's own. Cyborgs and anything mechanical really. Like cars. They're cool. With real engines though. The ones that go boom and burn dinosaur juice. Not those quiet wooshy things that run off stored lighting or something. Yeah I'm a stereotypical male for that. But IDGAF.

I’m currently studying bioengineering. It's mostly cellular biology and physics rn but it'll get better. 

I’m looking to collaborate on... geez what are these questions? I'm just here for a university project. I don't even know how to use this thing.

How to reach me ... just DM ffs. How else would you reach me? Send me a letter?
